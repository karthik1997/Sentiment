There's a secret place I like to go
Everyone is there but their face don't show
If you get inside, you can't get out
There's no coming back, I hear them shout
Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you want to stay
But everyone just runs away
Oh there's a secret place I like to go
Everyone is there but their face don't show
If you get inside you can't get out
There's no coming back, I hear them shout
Let me in, get me out
Can't do more then twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace
Found it again in my secret place
Let me in, get me out
Can't do more then twist and shout
Lost my soul without a trace in disgrace
I hide from those that try to find me
Scary things that's right behind me
I lost myself, I must confess
I can't explain how I got this mess
Welcome to my hide away, my secret place
How I arrived I can't explain
You're welcome to, if you wanna stay
But everyone just runs away
My secret place, there's a secret place
My secret place, there's a secret place
I like to go, my secret place
There's a secret place, just runs away
My secret place
