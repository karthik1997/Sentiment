The killers lie in wait for innocent blood
Swallow the lives of harmless souls
Walking a crooked path
Their wicked names will rise
Evil lives in the dark
(It's right to be feeling wrong)
The torment never ends
(It never ends)
The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane
Trapped in this no man's land
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned
To the realms of the never dead
There's no one you can trust upon this grave
Die with those face we're to defend
The feeding all the wars
They'll feed up in the end
Evil lives in the dark
(It's right to be feeling wrong)
The torment never ends
(It never ends)
The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane
Trapped in this no man's land
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned
To the realms of the never dead
Dead sweeps before you
To crush on the suicide
Blood spills out of your body
You'll weather and die
For the rest of your life
In the realms of the never dead
The fire that burns inside
That's blistering their brains
That makes them sacrifice
That's driving them insane
Trapped in this no man's land
Where angels dare to tread
Forever banned
To the realms of the never dead
