A cockroach in the concrete
Courthouse tan and beady eyes
A slouch with fallen arches
Purging truths into great lies
A little man with a big eraser
Changing history
Procedures that he's programmed to do
All he hears and sees
Altering the facts and figures
Events and every issue
Make a person disappear
And no one will ever miss you
Rewrites every story
Every poem that ever was
Eliminates incompetence
And those who break the laws
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules
Replacing rights with wrongs
The files and records in the schools
You say you've got the answers
Well who asked you anyway?
Ever think maybe it was meant to be this way?
Don't try to fool us
We know the worst is yet to come
I believe my kingdom will come
F is for fighting
R is for red, ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E we elect them
E we eject them, in the land of the free, and the home of the brave
D for dying
O your overture
M they will cover your grave with manure
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.
F is for fighting
R is for red, ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E we elect them
E we eject them, in the land of the free, and the home of the brave
D for dying
O your overture
M is for money and you know what that cures
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.
F is for fighting
R is for red, ancestors' blood in battles they've shed
E we elect them
E we eject them, in the land of the free, and the home of the brave
D for dying
O your overture
M they will cover your grave with manure
This spells out freedom, it means nothing to me
As long as there's a P.M.R.C.
Put your hand right up my shirt
Pull the strings that make me work
Jaws will part, words fall out
Like a fish with hook in mouth
Rewrites every story
Every poem that ever was
Eliminates incompetence
And those who break the laws.
Follow the instructions of the New Ways' Evil Book of Rules
Replacing rights with wrongs
The files and records in the schools
I'm not a fish
I'm a man
in Mouth!
