How much pain, do you need to feel.
How much shame, do you have to conceal.
There is no sunshine, just endless nights.
Nobody's there, nobody cares when you cry.
Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.
How many secrets, do you keep inside?
How many sins, do you have to hide?
The haunting masses, have blackened the sun.
You'll pay for everything you've done
One by one.
Is it my face you see?
Do I mock you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.
(Solo)
Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.
Is it my face you see?
Do I haunt you in your sleep?
On your hands and knees when you crawl
Through your nightmares.
When there's no more grace
Does your heartbeat start to race?
Crawling everywhere in the dark
Poisonous shadows.
(It's like I woke up and she was right there
you know, I can almost touch her
although she's been gone for years now
I can feel her
I can feel her watching me)
