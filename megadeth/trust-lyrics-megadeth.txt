Lost in a dream nothing is what it seems
Searching my head for the words that you said
Tears filled my eyes as we said our last goodbyes
The sad scene replays of you walking away
My body aches from mistakes betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much that in nothing we trust
Time and again she repeats let's be friends
I smile and say yes another truth bends, I must confess
I try to let go, but I know we'll never end 'til we're dust
We lied to each other again but I wish I could trust
My body aches from mistakes betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much that in nothing we trust
God help me please, on my knees betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much now there's nothing we trust
How could this be happening to me I'm lying when I say, "Trust me"
I can't believe this is true trust hurts, why does trust equal suffering?
My body aches from mistakes betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much that in nothing we trust
God help me please, on my knees betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much now there's nothing we trust
My body aches from mistakes betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much that in nothing we trust
God help me please, on my knees betrayed by lust
We lied to each other so much now there's nothing we trust
Absolutely nothing we trust!
