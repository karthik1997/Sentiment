Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep
If I should die (just) before i wake
I pray the lord my soul to take
I'm not going to wake up today
They've pulled my plug, the picture fades
and as my body decays
Mold begins to fill my grave
The smell of death permeates
The silk within my coffin lays
Go To Hell!
As they bury me now
Six feet there my body lies
Still feel like i'm going down
I hear a distant wailing cry
God something must have gone wrong!
Much to late i realize
Go To Hell!
(small guitar solo)
I saw my funeral that day
I know who didn't show to mourn
My judgment was life in hell
Pillars of pain and thorns
My only friends the goat
With 666 between his horns
Go To Hell!
Place all your trust here in me
Rest assured these things I know
and as Charon sails the sea
Your journey too shallow below
Ah yes!, you're all sitting ducks
Its true you reap what you sow
Go To Hell!
(guitar solo)
Now I lay me down to sleep
Blah blah blah my soul to keep
If I die before i wake
I'll go to hell for heavens sake!
