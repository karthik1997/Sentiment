Father time, I'm running late
I'm winding down, I'm growing tired
Seconds drift into the night
The clock just ticks till my time expires
You were once my friend
Now I know I can't tie your hands
The days I saved I couldn't spend
They fell like sand through the hourglass
No time to lose, no time to choose
Time taking time, it's taken mine
Scenes of my life seem so unkind
Time chasing time creeps up behind
I can't run forever, and time waits for no one
Not even me
I heard somebody fixed today
There was no last goodbyes to say
His will to live ran out
I heard somebody turned to dust
Looking back at what he left
A list of plans and photographs
Songs that never will be sung
These are the thinge he wont get done
Ive seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use the man
Ive seen them crawl from the cradle to the gutter on their hands
The fight a war but its fatal, its so hard to understand
Ive seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man
Just one shot to say goodbye
One last taste to mourn and cry
Scores and shoots, the lights go dim
Just one shot to do him in
He hangs his head and wonders why
Why the monkey only lies
But pay the pauper, he did choose
He hing his head inside the noose
Ive seen the man use the needle, seen the needle use that man
Ive seen them crawl from the cradle to the coffin on their hands
They fight a war but its fatal, its so hard to understand
Ive seen the man use the needle, seen the needle in his hand
Cryptic writing on the wall, the beginning of the end
Ive seen myself use the needle, seen the needle in my hand
