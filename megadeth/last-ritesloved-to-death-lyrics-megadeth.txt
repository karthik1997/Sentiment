Your body's empty now as I hold you
Now you're gone, I miss you but I told you
I remember bad times more than good
There's no coming back even if we could
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
If I can't have you then no one will
And I I won't I'll have to kill
My only love, something I've never felt
Now you've gone to Heaven and I'll burn in Hell
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
I loved you to death
And now I'm down below and what do I see?
You didn't go to heaven, you're down here with me
And now you're coming back, "Baby take me please"
I really think I would if you weren't such a sleaze
I loved you once before, you kept me on a string
I'd rather go without than take what you would bring
I'd rather go without than take what you would bring
I loved you to death
