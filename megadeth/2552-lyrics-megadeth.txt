I. Introduction
"November 1, 2552 A.D. The spaceship Evilzone arrives on Nuquledom, a bizar-
re planet located 600 billion miles, 10 and a half to the equator... sinist-
er forces abide by moonlight as scientists devise plots to detonate human desires and brutality amongst space travelers in the best interest of the solar system... In the darkest regions of dark space, slayers, offenders and
alien abductors are taking over Nuquledom, having slain humans and extrater-
restrial beings by stalking brains and facing fear amongst the farest areas
of this dreadful plante, the torture affecting their fate will be destroyed
by sinister extraterrestrial masterminds - eventually destroying the whole
planet, not only by chance, but by nuclear annihilation."
"As the solar system evolves into one curiosity-conscious force of death,
the end of the world will take place for 3,450 years and 2,700 centuries...
forcing Nuquledom on certain areas of attack... for billions of weeks, days
and months."
And now, the destruction of Nuquledom begins.

III. Truce Over Agony
Death and darkness are all around this planet
Everytime the planet explodes quickly in a future time
For each bullet of plutonium being hit there
Evil is the enemy of indestructible decline
For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters
Truce over agony will reign again - forever
Our society changes constantly
Torture is within life's hidden reach
This time, extraterrestrials turn head around the earth
And continue turning them around without terminal breach
For this is the kingdom and we are the troubleshooters
Truce over agony will reign again - forever
IV. The Cranial Clock
"To think, the planet Nuquledom has evolved into an indestructible village
- a world of the extraterrestrial underground where human and other adversa-
ries attack. As I enter the experimental intergalatic development center...
known as the National Association for Planetary Research... My partner in planetary combat has completed the development of a experimental space trav-
el adventure policy. He tells me when this scheme happens over the next few
years as scientists and mercenaries began the 52,000-week intergalatic batt-
leground. What the sciensts come up with will be the creation of the crani-
al clock."
"As the battle for control of the Ideatric System begins in honest, the
destruction of Nuquledom is carried out by the forces of evil... the wrath
of Nuquledom will be completed in 52,000 weeks; death is surrounded by the
inquisities of the National Association for Planetary Research by hard ways - doing everything the interrogators have in their power to survive."
Most often, by the sinister forces of evil in Nuquledom
Having performed their random acts of brutal distraction
What matters most likely, should they destroy the entire planet of life
No one is safe because of galatiic annihilation
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
Just stare at the interplanetary man
He gives each man a helping hand
Join in the Brothership of Mind Control
And attack each other by slamming intergalactic windfall
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
What we have done in our battle for semantic freedom
We hold the hands of the cranial clock of evil
Pessimism is falling as time slips away
Every space travel is being implanted with a computer chip
The travails of hell is as vital as it is brutal
No attention contact within every day
IIV. Interrogation Conspiracy Trap
"In June of 2553, the National Association for Planetary Research is em-
barking on a plan to detonate Nuquledom, as spaceship pilots continue their
battle for semantic combat during the first year of the annihilation of the
planet."
"For the slayers of human bodies, alien invaders attack the psychological
mystique found deep inside the realm of death. Nuquledom's commander in chief, Rex Nuclear, Ph.D., devises an early warning conspiracy that allows
Nuquledom to be blown up piecemeal within the next few decades."

V. Death Kills The Planet
"Even now distraction erupts again as the forces of danger dangle along
Nuquledom and the 25 planets of the Ideatric System by detonating all areas
of this dreadful community of extraterrestrial life. In the kingdom of inde-
structiveness, torture, death and greed subside in harmony as the annihilat-
ion of Nuquledom continues in the year 2557."
"What happens to visitors when they land on Nuquledom will see a great deal
of intergalatic fears and brutal straits of hell. I must oppose the abductor
and the scientist battling for control of the Ideatric System; and the fears
concerning Nuquledom are in flux as troubleshooters duke their traits of hell as the senses of sight, taste, hearing and touching coexsist."
"Let the destruction of the Ideatric System continue..."
Shoot the laws of gravity in space
Shoot stars directing interplanetary grace
Go after the darkness in the galaxy
Destroy all inhuman thought and reveal the alien enemy
Know what space travelers believe in humanity
What happens to the planetary straits affecting our society
Shoot back at torture and run all fear around
Not for the sake of heart, making for the last guy abound
Shoot back at the enemy behind enemy lines
Heating up controversy concerning inhuman decline
Under attack, slayers have been executed
Not by force, but by abduction
Face your intergalatic fears, vying to face destruction
