In my hour of need, ha!
No, you're not there
And though I reached out for you
Wouldn't lend a hand
Through the darkest hour
Grace did not shine on me
Feels so cold
Very cold
No one cares for me
Did you ever think I'd get lonely?
Did you ever think that I needed love?
Did you ever think?
Stop thinking
You're the only one
That I'm thinking of
You'll never know
How hard I tried
To find my space
And satisfy you too
Things will be better
When I'm dead and gone
Don't try to understand
Knowing you I'm probably wrong
But oh how I lived my life for you
Still you'd turn away
Now as I die for you
My flesh still crawls as I breathe your name
All these years
I thought I was wrong
Now I know it was you
Raise your head
Raise your face
Your eyes
Tell me
Who do you think you are?
I walk
I walk alone
To the promised land
There's a better place for me
But it's far, far away
Everlasting life for me
In a perfect world
But I gotta die first
Please god send me on my way
(Solo)
Time has a way of taking time
Loneliness is not only felt be fools
Alone I call to ease the pain
Yearning to be held by you
Alone so alone, I'm lost
Consumed by the pain
The pain, the pain, the pain
Won't you hold me again
You just laughed, ha ha
Bitch!
My whole life's work
Built on the past
Time has come when all things shall pass
This good thing passed away
