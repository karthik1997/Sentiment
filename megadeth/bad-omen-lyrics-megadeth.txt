Down fell the stars, as they
Splashed into the sea
"Mi nomine Baphomet"
Come dance with me
Sacrifice the virgins
Spiritual rites
Their master's time has come
The moon is full tonight
Drinking, dancing
They worship, and toast
The devil, who's watching
With demon's remote
Fire, rising
Racing in your blood
Possessed, naive
His service's done
It's the Sabbath, bloody Sabbath
Bad omen of the goat
Bloody blasphemy
Sinister's the word
As the demon's take their fill
An orgy's taking place
Human blood will spill
An act of worship
As they conceive the ghouls
Satan has their souls
They sing pagan tunes
The ceremony is sure to be cursed
They ask for his blessings
But down comes the worst
Their bodies, soulless
A corpse from the grave
Their minds are helpless
And no-one can save
No-one can save No-one can save them (oh no)
