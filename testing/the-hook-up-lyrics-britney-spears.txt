It's a dance thing!
(Blow!)
Boys and girls come sit down and ride on this rhythm
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
He was looking, said he want to up
But, she don't want to up, told him "Just go"
And then she look and said she want to up
You really want to up? Told her "Let's go"
Oh baby, I can't believe everything your body make me want to do
From the way that you move, now I think I'm in love with you
Grab my waist, want to get with the rhythm and the move you do, do
Switch my hips on the floor, move them slow, to keep up with you
Back it up, now, bump your rump, now
Grab my waist, now, work it out, now
Grab my shoulder, pick it up, now
Take it lower to the floor, now
Watch out, baby I'mma drop a little something
Ride it, baby we can do a little something
Take out, baby want to get a little something
You know baby, let's up a little something
Oh baby, I can't believe everything that I feel when I dance with you
From the small of my back to the breath on my neck
To that move you do
Put your body, got to get my body right next to you
Move the party, got to rock the party until the ooh-we-ooh
Back it up, now, bump your rump, now
Grab my waist, now, work it out, now
Grab my shoulder, pick it up, now
Take it lower to the floor, now
Back it up, now, bump your rump, now
Grab my waist, now, work it out, now

My whole world has changed, I'm living a fantasy
Tonight, I'm in the mood, please take me by your hand
I want to get in your groove, oh baby, take me there
Yo, everybody get up now!
If you sit down
Boy, I want to see you on the dance floor, move now
Yo, everybody dance!
The bodies are shaking, want to get my body keep shaking
Better get your butt out here baby, come on let's go
So do how you do it, drop it down, bend over, get to it
Make it pop back down to the ground, pick it up, let's go
The bodies are shaking, want to get my body keep shaking

So do how you do it, drop it down, bend over, get to it
