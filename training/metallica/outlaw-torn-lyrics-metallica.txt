And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
And now I wait my whole lifetime
For you
I ride the dirt, I ride the tide
For you
I search the outside, search inside
For you
To take back what you left me
I know I'll always burn to be
The one who seeks so I may find
And now I wait my whole lifetime
I'm outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
And I'm torn
So on I wait my whole lifetime
For you
So on I wait my whole lifetime
For you
The more I search the more my need
For you
The more I bless the more I bleed
For you
You make me smash the clock and feel
I'd rather die behind the wheel
Time was never on my side
So on I wait my whole lifetime
Outlaw torn
I'm outlaw torn
Yeah, I'm outlaw torn
And I'm torn
Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware, yeah
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me shut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
Hear me
And if I close my mind in fear
Please pry it open
See me
And if my face becomes sincere
Beware, yeah-e-yeah
Hold me
And when I start to come undone
Stitch me together
Save me
And when you see me shut
Remind me of what left this outlaw torn
