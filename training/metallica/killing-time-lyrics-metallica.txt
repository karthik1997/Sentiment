The sound of gunfire comes through the night
Killing and hatred, it's a terrible sight
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back
Preparations are made for the journey back
It's a survival, supplies are packed
No more nights in this eternal hell
Destination is simple, we move out
Killing time!
Move up to the line
Killing time!
Your turn to kill
Killing time!
What do you say?
Killing time!
I'm killing time!
And he knew what was needed to keep us alive
No time for cowardice, it's kill and survive
Like a killer kid with a switchblade knife
Nasty word, he'll take your life
The silence is over, the attack's began
Killing and hatred drive you insane
Reports come in of a heavy attack
Message received, we're moving back
Killing time!
Move up to the line
Killing time!
Your turn to kill
Killing time!
What do you say?
Killing time!
I'm killing time!
