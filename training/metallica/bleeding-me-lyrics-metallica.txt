I'm diggin' my way...
I'm diggin' my way to somethin'...
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better...
I'm pushin' to stay...
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin'...
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin' better...
Whoa ho, oh
Whoa ho, oh
I'm sowing the seeds...
I'm sowing the seeds I've taken...
I'm sowing the seeds I take for granted...
This thorn in my side...
This thorn in my side is from the tree...
This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
Ooh, it tears me and I bleed, yeah!
And I bleed, oh yeah, yeah!
Yeah!
Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, whoa!
Ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheels roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Of me
The bleeding of me...
Caught under wheels roll
I take the leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me, whoa!
Ooh, I can't take it
Caught under wheels roll
Oh, the bleeding of me
Oh, the bleeding of me...
Yeah!
I am the priest that feeds the beast
I am the blood
I am release
Come make me pure
Bleed me a cure
I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under
Caught under wheels roll
I take that leech
I'm bleeding me
Can't stop to save my soul
I take the leash that's leading me
I'm bleeding me
Oh, I can't take it
I can't take it
I can't take it
Oh, the bleeding of me
Ooh, come on, baby!
(Solo)
Mmmm, yeah...
I'm diggin' my way...
I'm diggin' my way to somethin'...
I'm diggin' my way to somethin' better...
I'm pushin' to stay...
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin'...
I'm pushin' to stay with somethin' better...
With somethin' better...
