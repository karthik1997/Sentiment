Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh
Yeah
Yeah
Turn on, I see red
Adrenaline crash, crack my head
Nitro junkie, paint me dead
And I see red
A hundred plus through black and white
War horse
War head
Fuck 'em, man
White knuckle tight
Through black and white
Ooh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
Loose and clean
Ooh
And then I burn
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Yeah
Turn on beyond the bone
Swallow future, spit out hope
Burn your face upon the chrome
Yeah, oh yeah
Take the corner, going to crash
Headlights
Headlines
Another junkie, lives too fast
Yeah
Lives way too fast, fast, fast, fast
Ooh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
Loose and clean
Ooh
And then I burn
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
So gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh, yeah
White knuckle tight
Ooh
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
My desire
Ooh
On I burn
Fuel is pumping engines
Burning hard
Loose and clean
Ooh
And on and on
Turning my direction
Quench my thirst with gasoline
Gimme fuel
Gimme fire
Gimme that which I desire
Ooh
On I burn
