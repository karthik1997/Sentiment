dont let this streetlife get ya down
dont let this streetlife run u around
{snoop}
since i was young i grew up in the streetlife
times get hard for a gangstar in the streetlife
aint no tellin what my life might be like, growin up in the streetlife
you cant tell me shit, about these streets homie
i done lived it and done it, runnin from the police
out for the money, homies maintain there composure
now that we olders we sellin ki's, bye the douzia
now im a soulja muthafucka for the chips wanna dip to trip
headed straight for dc, down for dp.
flipt the script and came equipted with some riders who got my back
snoop coliogne, you know im always down to jack
i jack for instant thought,talkin walk the walk
niggas who oppose automaticly get stomped
terrorizing the neighborhood niggas gaining they grab me
southside and dash, mashin for the rep
rest in peace to deseiced homeboyz who aint alive
streetlife took him over now he forced to die
slippin and sliddin, bouncin counting my ends
to be straight, times is ruff for these dayz
niggas is crazy, but the fear is much greater, the inavater, dominator
soul creater, out for the papers!
since i was young i grew up in the streetlife
{2pac}
bustin and balein, thugs addicted to drug saling
ki's got me riskin, living the street, catch a fellonie
how many niggas wanna see me gone?
you bitches is playa haters who hate to see a nigga hold his own
forever ballin and never fallin
live my life as a thug, now can you hear the liquor callin
when we blaze niggas is blinded
my compotion is minimual so i live, criminal minded
nigga can you hear me wave yo pistols in the ski
and roll a phat ass blunt, i bet that shit will get you high
they wonder why im hard to kill, hard to let go
how can i die and leave my peers on deathrow
im makaveli,45, tatto my belly
conversating wit my nigga dogg, lyrics so deadly
when ya come to get me bring an army
an outlaw muthafucka, who can harm me
bomb the clip and see the track smokin
cause real badboy killas be them gat toaters
ha ha, open ya eyes and understand me
world aint fair these muthafuckas doin scandlous see
niggas dont wanna see me hot with my glock cocked
drinkin on hen, screamin fuck the world this is the end, in the streetlife!
