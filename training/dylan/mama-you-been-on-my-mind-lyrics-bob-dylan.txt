Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat
An' cov'rin' the crossroads I'm standing at,
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that,
But mama, you been on my mind.
I don't mean trouble, please don't put me down or get upset,
I am not pleadin', or sayin' "I can't forget you."
I do not pace the floor bowed down an' bent, but yet,
Mama, you been on my mind.
Even though my eyes are hazy an' my thoughts they might be narrow,
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down in sorrow.
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow,
Mama, you're just on my mind.
I am not askin' you to say words like "yes" or "no,"
Please understand me, I've no place I'm calling you t' go.
I'm just whisperin' to myself, so I can't pretend that I don't know,
Mama, you are on my mind.
When you wake up in the mornin', baby, look inside your mirror.
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near.
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind.
