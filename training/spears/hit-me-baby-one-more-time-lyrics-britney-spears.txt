Oh baby, baby...
Oh baby, baby...
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
And now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby
'Cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killin me
(And I)
I must confess I still believe
(Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
The reason I breathe is you
Boy you got me blinded
Oh pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby
'Cause I need to know now
Oh, because
My loneliness is killin me
(And I)
I must confess I still believe
(Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Oh baby baby
How was I supposed to know
Oh pretty baby
I shouldn't have let you go
I must confess, that my loneliness
Is killing me now
Don't you know I still believe
That you will be here
And give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
My loneliness is killin me
(And I)
I must confess I still believe
(Still believe)
When I'm not with you I lose my mind
Give me a sign
I must confess
(My loneliness)
That my loneliness
(Is killing me)
Is killing me now
(I must confess)
Don't you know I still believe
(Still believe)
That you will be here
(I'm losing
Hit me one more time
