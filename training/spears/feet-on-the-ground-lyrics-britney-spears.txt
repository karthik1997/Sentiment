Things were not progressing
dont pretend you didnt know
all the bullshit
they were turnin my life into a show
Took some time to heal the wounds i had to improvise
pay no mind to all the rumors just a buncha lies
Fall back fall back
burnin up all my bridges
fall back fall back
makin the wrong decision
fall back fall back
im in a new transition
takin back the reins again
ive changed my ways
I can tell you that i feel my feet on the ground again
you can see im firmly standing feet on the ground again
i was lost a while but my feet on the ground again
you cant bring me down i got my feet on the ground again
Things were gettin crazy
so i had to strategize
look at me im changin and its right before your eyes
No, its not fine
this is my pride
lost - to my life
ive had enough of it
Fall back fall back
burnin up all my bridges
fall back fall back
makin the wrong decision
fall back fall back
im in a new transition
takin back the reins again
ive changed my ways
I can tell you that i feel my feet on the ground again
you can see im firmly standing feet on the ground again
I was lost a while but my feet on the ground again
you can't bring me down i got my feet on the ground again
All of this obsession, isnt it a bit too much?
cant believe that some of you think i have lost my touch
Was a phase
I just have to
rewind the days
let me out
c'mon set me free
you were waitin for the new me
its complete
Fall back fall back
you were my inspiration
fall back fall back
this is my dedication
I can tell you that i feel my feet on the ground again
you can see im firmly standing feet on the ground again
I was lost a while but my feet on the ground again
you can't bring me down i got my feet on the ground again
