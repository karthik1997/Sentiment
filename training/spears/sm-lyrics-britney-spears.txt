Feels so good being bad
There's no way I'm turning back
Now the pain is my pleasure
Cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine
Out the box, out of line
The affliction of the feeling
Leaves me wanting more
Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me
Na na na, come on!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
I like it, like it!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
Na na na, come on!
I like it, like it!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
I like it, like it! Just one night full of sin
Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your time to hurt me
Yeah
If I'm bad tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
Cos the pain is my pleasure
Nothing comes better
Yeah
Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me
Na na na, come on!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
I like it, like it!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
Na na na, come on!
I like it, like it!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
I like it, like it!

Oh
I love the feeling
You bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what
I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
With my body suit on, on, on
I like it
Like it
Cause I may be bad
But I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care
I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones
May break my bones
But chains and whips
Excite me
Na na na, come on!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
I like it, like it!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
Na na na, come on!
I like it, like it!
Come on! Come On! Come on!
I like it, like it!
