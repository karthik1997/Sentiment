(Oh daddy daddy!)
(Oh daddy daddy!)
Teach me teach me
I'm just a little girl
With lovin' on her mind
Reach me reach me
Give me a spin and twirl
From all the way behind
Tell me how to hold it
While we, while it's growin
Baby, it's so swollen
Now we're flowin'
Whoops! Explosion!
You're older and it's thrilling me (Yeah yeah!)
Too bad our love's a felony (A felony!)
Your big like daddy,
I'll open wide
Put it inside
Lick my baby back behind!
You do protest that i'm jailbait (Jailbait!)
I'm just 16, but I just can't wait (I just can't wait!)
My mom's real cool,
-promise-
You won't do time!
Lick my baby back behind!

Oh, daddy, daddy

Teach me, teach me
I'm just a little girl,
With loving on her mind.
Reach me, reach me,
Give me a spin and twirl,
From all the way behind.
Tell me how to hold it,
While we, why it's growing,
Baby, it's so swollen,
Now we're flowin',
Whoops! Explosion
Your older hand is thrilling me (yeah, yeah),
Too bad our love's a felony (a felony),
You're big like Daddy,
I'll open wide,
Put it inside,
Lick my baby back behind.
You do protest that I'm jailbait (jailbait),
I'm just sixteen, but I just can't wait (I just can't wait),
My mom's real cool,
Promise,
You won't do time,
Lick my baby back behind.
