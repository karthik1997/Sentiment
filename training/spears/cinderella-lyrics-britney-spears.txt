I used to be your girlfriend and I know I did it well
Oh, yes, you know it's true!
You'd call me Cinderella
All you had to do was yell,
And I'd be there for you
Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are
With nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay!
I'm sorry for runnin' away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Ah-Oh!
But Cinderella's got to go
From time to time I'd try to tell you just what was on my mind
You'd told me, "not today"
Come back, do that, where's Cinderella at?
Was all you had to say!
Here I am
So try to forgive me
I don't believe in fairytales
Here we are
With nothing but honesty
I've had enough
I'm not gonna stay!
I'm sorry for runnin' away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Ah-Oh!
But Cinderella's got to go
I'm sorry, just tryin' to live me life
Don't worry
You're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go!
You used to say, "I want you"
You cast me in your spell
I did everything you wanted me to
But, now, I shall
Break free from all your lies
I won't be blind, you see
My love, it can't be sacrificed
I won't return to thee
(I'm so sorry)
(I've already)
(Made up my mind!)
I won't return to thee
I'm sorry to say
I'm runnin' away now
Don't worry, you will be alright
I runnin' away
I've made up my mind now
You're gonna have to let me go!
(She's gotta go!)
I'm sorry for runnin' away like this
And I'm sorry, I've already made my wish
Ah-Oh!
But Cinderella's got to go!
I'm sorry, just tryin' to live my life
Don't worry, you're gonna be alright
But Cinderella's got to go!
