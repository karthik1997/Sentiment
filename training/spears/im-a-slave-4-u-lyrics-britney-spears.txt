I know I may be young but
I've got feelings too
and I need to do
what I feel like doing
so let me go and just listen.
All you people look at me
like I'm a little girl,
well did you ever think it'd be okay
for me to step into in this world.
Always saying: "little girl,
don't step into the club"
well I'm just tryin' to find out why
'cause dancing's what I love.
Get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
I know I may come off quiet
may come off shy
but I feel like talking feel like dancing when I see this guy.
What's practical is logical,
what the hell, who cares
all I know is I'm so happy
when you're dancing there.
I'm a slave for you...
I cannot hold it,
I cannot control it;
I'm a slave for you...
I won't deny it,
I'm not trying to hide it.
Baby
don't you wanna dance up on me...?
(I just wanna dance next to you...)
to another time and place.
Oh baby
don't you wanna dance up on me...?
(are you ready...?)
leaving behind my name and age.
Let's go...
like that...
you like it...
yeah...
now watch me.
Get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
I really wanna dance
tonight with you...
(I just can't help myself...)
I really wanna do
what you want me to...
(I just feel I let myself go).
I really wanna dance
tonight with you...
(I wanna see you move...)
I really wanna do
what you want me to.
Baby
don't you wanna dance up on me...?
(I just wanna dance next to you...)
to another time and place.
Oh baby
don't you wanna dance up on me...?
(are you ready...?)
leaving behind my name and age.
I'm a slave for you...
(like that...)
I cannot hold it,
I cannot control it.
I'm a slave...
(it just feels right...)
for you...
(it just feels good...)
I won't deny it,
I'm not trying to hide it, baby.
Get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
Get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
get it, get it, whoa!
I'm a slave for you...
(here we go now...)
I cannot hold it,
I cannot control it.
I'm a slave for you...
(here we go...)
I won't deny it,
I'm not trying to hide it, yeah...
like that!
