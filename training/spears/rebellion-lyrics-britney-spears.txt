Be wary of others
The ones closest to you (oh)
The poison they feed you
And the voodoo that they do
But in rebellion
There's a sparkle of truth
Don't just stand there
Do what you got to do
You'll find it in rebellion
Your body starts breathing
They're not believing what they're seeing
'Cause you're rebellion
You'll find it so compelling
With everyone yelling
'Cause your soul, you're not selling
'Cause you're rebellion
