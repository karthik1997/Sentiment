I used to think
I had the answers to everything
But now I know
That life doesn't always go my way, yeah
Feels like I'm caught in the middle
That's when I realize
I'm not a girl, not yet a woman
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between, I'm not a girl
There is no need to protect me
It's time that I
Learn to face up to this on my own
I've seen so much more than you know now
So don't tell me to shut my eyes
I'm not a girl
(Not a girl, not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman
(Trying to find the woman in me)
All I need is time, a moment that is mine
While I'm in between, I'm not a girl
But if you look at me closely
You will see it in my eyes
This girl will always find her way
(I'm not a girl)
I'm not a girl, don't tell me what to believe
(Not yet a woman)
I'm just trying to find the woman in me, yeah
(All I need is time)
Oh, all I need is time
(A moment that is mine)
That's mine, while I'm in between
I'm not a girl
(I'm not a girl, not a girl, not yet a woman)
Not yet a woman, no no
(I'm just trying to find the woman in me)
All I need is time
(All I need is time)
A moment that is mine
(A moment that is mine)
While I'm in between
I'm not a girl, ooh, not yet a woman
