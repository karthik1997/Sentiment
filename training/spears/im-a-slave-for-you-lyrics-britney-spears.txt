I know I may be young
But I've got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen
All you people look at me like I'm a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying "Little girl, don't step into the club"
Well I'm just trying to find out why
'cause dancing's what I love, yeah (Now watch me)
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
(This feels good)
I know I may come off quiet, may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What's practical? What's logical? What the hell? Who cares?
All I know is I'm so happy when you're dancing there, yeah
I'm a slave for you
I can not hold it, I can not control it
I'm a slave for you
I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it
Baby, don't you want to dance up on me?
(I just want to dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh baby, don't you want to dance up on me?
(Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age
Let's go
Like that
Do you like it?
Yeah? Now watch me!
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
(This feels good)
I really want to dance tonight with you
(I just can't help myself)
I really want to do what you want me to
(I just got to let myself go)
I really want to dance tonight with you
(I want to see you move)
I really want to do what you want me to
Baby, don't you want to dance up on me?
(I just want to dance next to you)
To another time and place
Oh baby, don't you want to dance up on me?
(Are you ready?)
Leaving behind my name and age
I'm a slave for you
I can not hold it, I can not control it
I'm a slave for you
(It just feels right, it just feels good)
I won't deny it, I'm not trying to hide it
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
(Just move with me)
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
Get it-get it, get it-get it, what?
I'm a slave for you
(Here we go now, here we go now)
I can not hold it
I can not control it
(You like the way I move huh?)
I'm a slave for you
(Here we go)
I won't deny it
(Yeah, yeah)
I'm not trying to hide it
(Yeah, like that)
