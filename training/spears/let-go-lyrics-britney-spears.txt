Its written everywhere
Ive even read it in my script
But when I thought it wasnt fair
I felt it on my lips, let go
I dont wanna be the one
I think you already know, oh
The feeling of going down way too deep
Holding on
So you wont lose your feet
Sometimes you just gotta trust
You gotta take that leap
And let go
Gotta let go
Ive got a feeling
By your look youre through
Oh no
What youre revealing
I sit and pray
And I will pull through, oh no yeah
When you let go
Of all youve known
The butterflies fly
And you will see the rainbows
And all the love
Everything will be shown
So let go
Let go
The touch of grass
The air
The sun it will rise
You will see so clear
It will bring tears to your eyes
Maybe everything will be alright
So let go
You gotta let go
Ive got a feeling
Right now
You feel it too
Oh, oh
This little song
Might be the one
That will tell us what to do
Oh, oh, ooh, ooh
These tears are overflowing
And never knowing why
All these years weve been
Weve been hurting
We have to look inside
And try
To let go
You gotta let go
To love, you gotta let go
If you really wanna love
You gotta let go
