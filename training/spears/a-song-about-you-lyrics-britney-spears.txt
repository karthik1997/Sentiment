I know you hear me on your radio
Well here we go
Please turn up your radio
Wanna tell you somethin
Hear me on your radio
Well here wo go
Please turn up your radio
Wanna tell you somethin
There was a time
I used to think
That love would never turn into reality
I never thought
I'd find the one
But I tell I'm drawn to you a strength of none
You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try but they can't touch ( touch )
You gotta look up to us
Cause your love is outta this world ( oooh )
how you bring me down to earth
I love how you put me first ( oooh )
Make me feel my every word
Cause I'm sayin, you know this is about you
I keep sayin you know this is about you
there'll always be
This is about you
Our love is here to stay
there'll always be a song about you
Forever, everyday
there'll always be a song about you
I'll be your moon
I'll make it bright
And when it's dark I promise that you'll see the light
And just as far as the moon is from the sun
That's how long that I'll be here
And it's because
You must be from heaven, baby, yes you are
Your love is like a shooting star
So they can try but they can't touch
You gotta look up to us
Cause your love is outta this world ( oooh )
How you bring me down to earth
I love how you put me first ( oooh )
Make me feel my every word
Cause I'm sayin, you know this is about you
I keep sayin, you know this is about you
there'll always be
this is about you
Our love is here to stay
there'll always be a song about you
Forever, everyday
there'll always be a song about you
