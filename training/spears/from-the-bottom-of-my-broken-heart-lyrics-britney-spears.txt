Ooo-Hoo hoo hoo
Na na na na na na
Never look back we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
Loneliness up ahead
Emptiness behind, where do I go?
And you didn't hear all my joy through my tears
All my hopes through my fears, did you know?
Still I miss you somehow
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new
You were my real love, I never knew love
Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart
Baby I said please stay
Give our love a chance for one more day
We could've worked things out
Taking time is what love's all about
But you put a dart through my dreams, through my heart
And I'm back where I started again, yeah
Never thought it would end
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two I'd like you to know
You were my first love, i never knew but
Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart
You promised yourself
But to somebody else
And you made it so perfectly clear, yeah
Still I wish you were here now
From the bottom of my broken heart
There's just a thing or two (A thing or two) you gotta know (you gotta know)
(You were my first love) You were my first love, you were my true love
From the first kisses to the very last rose
From the bottom of my broken heart
Even though time may find me somebody new (You're my real love)
You were my real love, I never knew love
Til there was you
From the bottom of my broken heart
Never look back we said
How was I to know I'd miss you so?
