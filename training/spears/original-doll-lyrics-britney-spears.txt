Everybody look at me,
But nobody knows
What I have, who I am...
Don't tell me what I have to do
(To do)
I'm not have you, my shoe!
(My shoe)
I know wahat you say
I'm just one more chick,
But now... Stop!
Not a chick, not your,
I'm a doll!
If you think I'm that girl
You are wrong 'cause now I am..
Original!
What you lie to my friends?
You are a beutiful, but no mind.
I'm a doll, I want to be more pretty
No... Stop!
Chorus (3X)
Can`t you see me?
