Ya!
Yeah...
Aay, shorty.
You're so sweet
Stranger, A stranger
Candy from a stranger
Excuse ma, but you're sick
sweeter than a Hershey Kiss
Come, be my desert in this
I put my spoon in your dip
Oooh!
We got one night only
Hope you brought some jolly ranchers for me
Then she told me;
I don't even know you
But here, I got a snicker for you, here!
What you do to me, I just can't believe
Oh, you're tempting me
Candy you're so sweet
It's been too long
Oh, it feels so wrong
Danger, Danger, candy from a stranger
You don't need to sugar coat it
I got it, and you know it
All of the pieces with it
Candy from strangers
Candy from strangers
Candy from a stranger
Shorty, have a bite
I will fill your appetite
I know your mom said not to
But, I'll change your life after tonight
Bet you never tried it, and I guarantee you'll like it
And I know you can't resist, so don't fight it, don't
Come give it to me
A stranger
Come get some
A stranger
Just like that
A stranger
Don't be scared, don't be scared
Mama use to tell me
Don't take candy from a stranger
But girl, you look so sweet
You got me reaching with my fingers
She said don't take candy from a stranger,
candy from a stranger, candy from a stange, a stranger
