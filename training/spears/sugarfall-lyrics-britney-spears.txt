My mama told me go on and let you go
Said you would be more problems than Id ever know
Said if hes gonna go then let him go away
But then I get the urge
It hurts so bad (damn)
When I feel the thirst
It makes me mad
I look up in my bed
I look up and there is your face
You love it, you love it
Im so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
Youre so good
On a good day
Sugarfall
Your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe
I heard it in the streets
You got another girl
Yes, it did sting
But didnt shatter my world (Im ok)
You should catch me now
When Im in a vulnerable state
You're probably thinking to yourself
This just aint me
On the contrary
I was your freak (I was your freak)
Hit me one more time
And trust me Ill be ok
Hey
You love it, you love it
Im so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
Youre so good
On a good day
Sugarfall
Your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe
Now I will be a bad chick
If I rounded up my clothes
And headed over straight to the door
You wouldnt have a clue
Of what you should do
If I left you laying longing for more
You'd be like baby dont go (dont go)
Baby
Want some more?
You want some more?
Baby dont go (just dont go)
Said baby please listen
Dont you just go
Do you lick your lips?
When you stand alone
Well you got no x-ray vision
Staring through my clothes
Are you sure that youre prepared
For what comes serves on its plate
Wait a minute
Oooh, Im having second thoughts
See my hearts on fault
Could you pass my shorts?
Dont you got a girl?
Till then
Im sorry, you must wait
Especially since I know
You love it, you love it
Im so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
Youre so good
On a good day
Sugarfall
Your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe
Hey girl
Im so hooked on it (hooked on it)
You want it, you want it
Youre so good
On a good day
Sugarfall
Your sugarfall
You make my sugarfall (sugarfall)
You know you want it bad, babe
Hey girl
You know you want it
So come and get it
